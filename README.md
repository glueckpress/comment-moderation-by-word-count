# Comment Moderation by Word Count
Sends a comment to moderation queue if it contains more than a given number of words.

## Description

This simple WordPress plugin displays a message in any single post that has been published x years ago from the current time or earlier. The default time to count back is 1 year, but you can [change that](//wordpress.org/plugins/aged-content-message/faq/).

**Props:** This plugin solely exists, because [Mika Epstein](https://github.com/ipstenu) [tweeted](https://twitter.com/Ipstenu/status/627130377828564993) her idea. :bouquet:

### Languages
* English (en_US) _(default)_
* German (de_DE)
* German formal (de\_DE_formal)

## Installation
* If you don’t know how to install a plugin for WordPress, [here’s how](http://codex.wordpress.org/Managing_Plugins#Installing_Plugins).
* You might want to check the folder name after you downloaded and unzipped the ZIP file. GitHub appends suffixes to the actual folder name; you should always edit it to be equal to this repository’s name before uploading to WordPress.
* After you have activated the plugin, you can configure your preferred word count for comment moderation in Settings → Discussion.

## Changelog

### 0.1
